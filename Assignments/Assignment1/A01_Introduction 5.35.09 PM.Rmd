## 1) Finish setting up R Studio

### Install TinyTex
Now, run this code cell the same way. This will install "tinytex" -- a helper app that allows you to knit your markdown documents into professional quality PDFs.
```{r install tiny tex, eval=FALSE, include=FALSE}
#install tinytext
tinytex::install_tinytex()
```

### Set your default knit directory
This setting will help deal with relative paths later on...
 - From the Tool menu, select `Global Options`
 - Select the RMarkdown section
 - In the "Evaluate chunks in directory", set the option to "Project" (If you don't see this option, try restarting RStudio.)


## 2) Discussion Questions
Enter answers to the questions just below the >Answer: prompt.

1. What are your previous experiences with data analytics, R, and Git? Include both formal and informal training.


> Answer: I majored in statistics when I was in undergrad school and had taken classes like linear modeling, data visualization, and etc.. Many of those classes require the students to use R.

2. Are there any components of the course about which you feel confident?

> Answer: I had some experience with r programming before

3. Are there any components of the course about which you feel apprehensive?

> Answer: Not familiar with the environmental part


## 3) GitHub
